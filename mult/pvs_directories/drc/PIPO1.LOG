WARNING (XSTRM-20): Output Stream file '/home/mgrawe2/ece482.work/gpdk045_new/ece482_final_project/mult/pvs_directories/drc/mult.gds' already exists. It will be overwritten.
INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, /class/ece482/gpdk045_v_6_0/gpdk045/gpdk045.layermap
WARNING (XSTRM-333): The '-enableColoring' option will be ignored during XStream Out. This is because there is no color entry in the layer map and the object map file.
INFO (XSTRM-427): Based on current hardware configuration, running XStream Out translation in multi-threaded mode with 4 threads.
INFO (XSTRM-162): You have not used the '-viaMap' option. If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the '-viaMap' option for preserving oaVia instances in a XStream Out - XStream In round trip. Using the '-viaMap' option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.

INFO (XSTRM-180): You have not used the '-objectMap' option. The design has instance(s) of at least one of following OpenAccess objects: oaBlockage, oaBoundary, oaRow, and oaMarker. Any information about these objects will not be translated into the generated stream file. Use the '-objectMap' option to translate/preserve these objects using XStream.
