INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, /class/ece482/gpdk045_v_6_0/gpdk045/gpdk045.layermap
WARNING (XSTRM-333): The '-enableColoring' option will be ignored during XStream Out. This is because there is no color entry in the layer map and the object map file.
INFO (XSTRM-427): Based on current hardware configuration, running XStream Out translation in multi-threaded mode with 4 threads.
INFO (XSTRM-162): You have not used the '-viaMap' option. If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the '-viaMap' option for preserving oaVia instances in a XStream Out - XStream In round trip. Using the '-viaMap' option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.
